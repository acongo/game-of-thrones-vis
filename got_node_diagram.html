    <h1>Game of Thrones Kill Graph</h1>
    <h3>Explore the links between killer and killed in this visualization of Game of Thrones'
        major characters. An arrow originating from character A and pointing to character B
        indicates character A killed character B. An isolated character with an arrow pointing
        to themselves indicates death by suicide, accident, or natural causes. The donut graph
        around each character indicates their favorite weapons of choice as a proportion of their
        total weapons used for murder (inclusive of kills against
        minor characters not shown in this diagram).
